# PresentationEngine
This engine was created as a replacement for all the crap presentation programs I've been unsing, looking at you powerpoint and presi. I'm aiming to create a presentation engine along with contents and scripting style akin to LATEX where you can just script all your content and the engine compiles into an awesome presentation.

Current Versions
 - Mario Presenter v1, presentation created in Mario
  -- TODO: port over the auto generation tool
 - Carrousel Presenter v1, presentation as a carrousel format. Exported as unity package, still requires work
  -- TODO: add a system to allow a folder to simply be populated. I'm scared of bugs and file parsin. Will hold off on this for now...
